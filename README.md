# System Design - High-Performance Backend Patterns

This repository contains **practical system design patterns** focused on building
**scalable, low-latency, and high-throughput backend systems**.

All implementations use **Node.js + TypeScript** in a **TurboRepo monorepo** structure.

## System Design References

- **[Cache Design for Low-Latency Reads and Reduced Backend Load](./docs/CACHE.md)**
  - Covers cache placement, eviction, TTL, consistency, failure modes, and ops best practices
  - Focuses on Redis-style caching with practical defaults
  - Designed as a quick reference for interviews and real systems

## Implemented Services

### 1 Bloom Filter–Backed Username Service


**App:** [`apps/bloom-filter-backed-user-service`](./apps/bloom-filter-backed-user-service)  
**Library:** [`packages/bloom-filter`](./packages/bloom-filter)  
**Docs:** [`docs/BLOOM_FILTER.md`](./docs/BLOOM_FILTER.md)


**What it demonstrates**
- Space-efficient probabilistic data structures
- Reducing unnecessary database reads
- Handling false positives with DB verification
- Mathematical tuning of Bloom Filter parameters (`m`, `k`, `p`)

**Key concepts**
- Bloom Filter theory → real implementation
- Cache-before-DB access pattern
- Latency and database load reduction
- Trade-off between memory usage and accuracy

### 2 Cache-Backed User Service (FIFO & LRU)

**App:** [`apps/cache-backed-user-service`](./apps/cache-backed-user-service)  
**Library:** [`packages/cache`](./packages/cache)  
**Docs:** [`docs/CACHE.md`](./docs/CACHE.md)

**What it demonstrates**
- Cache-aside pattern
- FIFO vs LRU eviction strategies
- TTL-based expiration (lazy eviction)
- Real-time cache metrics & observability

**Implemented features**
- FIFO cache
- LRU cache
- Configurable capacity and TTL
- Hit / miss / eviction metrics
- Measured latency improvement:
  - **Cold request:** ~700ms
  - **Cached request:** ~4-7ms

**Key concepts**
- Temporal locality
- Eviction policy trade-offs
- Infrastructure vs business logic separation
- Measuring assumptions instead of guessing

---

## Design Goals

- Keep read paths fast and predictable under load
- Protect databases and downstream services from unnecessary traffic
- Use simple designs first, then optimize based on measurements
- Be explicit about consistency, memory, and latency trade-offs
- Treat metrics as the source of truth, not assumptions

---

## Planned Additions

- Rate limiting
- Distributed ID generation
- Consistent hashing and caching
- Multi-node Bloom Filters
- Cache stampede handling
- and much more...
